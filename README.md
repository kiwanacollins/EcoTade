Role/Goal:
You are an expert front-end developer. I want you to replicate the UI from a screenshot that shows a list of payment methods in a grid layout. Each payment method is presented in a card-like format with the following details:

Payment method name ("Bank", “Airtel”, “MTN”, “Bitcoin”, "Ethereum", USD Coin and Tether USD/USDT)
Processing time (“Instant”, “Instant”, “Instant, "30 minutes”, "30 minutes")
Fee (e.g., “0%”)
A logo/icon for each payment method (if possible, place a placeholder image or use an icon from a library).
An optional “verification required” label on some methods.
Layout Requirements:

The payment methods are arranged in a grid with multiple rows and columns (from the screenshot, it appears to be 2 cards per row).
Each card has a white or light background with a subtle border or shadow.
Each card should have the payment method’s logo/icon, name, processing time, fee, limits, and optionally the “Currently not available for bank, airtel, mtn” label.
Make the layout responsive so that on smaller screens, the cards stack vertically or adjust gracefully.
Data to Display (from top-left to bottom-right in the screenshot):

Use a clean, modern style with consistent margins, padding, and fonts.
Each card might show the payment method’s name in bold, the processing time/fee/limits in a smaller font.
If using icons, place them to the left of the text or at the top of the card.
Use a visually distinct way (e.g., a badge or a small pill-shaped label) to highlight “Currently Not Available.”
Technical Instructions:

The design should be fully responsive.

Displays all the payment methods in a 2-column layout.
Shows the correct text for each payment method (name, processing time, fee, limits).
Highlights the “Currently Not Available” methods with a distinct label.
Uses placeholders or real icons for each payment method’s logo.
